 # Unity_ChicagoSurvivalist
A survival adventure game that simulates the life among the hazards occur in Chicago. Exaggeration intended.


Design and Development ===================================================

The project is intended as both a portfoilo and as a personal hobby. My idea for this game is simple: Living in Chicago could be an amazing experience, but it's also unsafe to overlook
some of the issues and hazards Chicago presents. So I built this mobile game that stretch out the reality just for the fun of it, and for the people whose life can relate.

Prior to this project I had another project, a multiplayer shooter game, from which I had learnt a few things. One of the things is that I have to have a clean coding habbit, to use better
design pattern that suits and, last but not the least, to not set the bar too high. Due to overambition and a lack of planning, the first project was over-bloated with codes very quickly, 
and yet inefficient. As a result, it went through many unnecessary overhauls, wasted a lot of time and resources.

Having picked up the lessons from that project, now I have found myself improved upon my previous experience: Start small, manage well and develop steadily.
